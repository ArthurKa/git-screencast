# Git screencast

As of now, Git screencast is about 14 hours of high quality educational material about Git. 

It's here: http://learn.javascript.ru/screencast/git, but we look forward to put it to a separate domain, as it's not related to Javascript. 

It is in Russian, because that language is most convenient for me, and I can ensure good language and pronunciation.

**Here we translate it to English, and that will be the base version for other translators, Chinese and other languages.**

There are following independant work parts here:

## Subtitles from the Russian version.

Requirements: understanding Russian.

There are three parts here:

Review the translation to ensure good English (needs only native English).
Check the text to ensure correctness, just in case (needs good Git knowledge, but a student may be ok too, they can signal if an explanation is not clear and learn Git in the process)
Voice the English version (may require a Mac, cause the screencast is written using Mac-only software, and normal/good English diction).
All that can be done by different people or by the same person.
